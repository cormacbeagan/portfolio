<p>
  For years I have been looking for a way to recommend works of street art to
  the guests of the hostel where I have been working for these past years.
  However it is not easy to give someone directions to a random motorway bridge
  over the Isar....

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting

### React

<GridStyles flip grow fade>
  <div>
    <p>
      The project was started with Create React App, and makes good use of
      Reacts component base architecture and the latest functional/hook based
      syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has however grown significantly from the original graffiti map leading
      to the adoption of a few advanced features:
    </p>
    <p>&#x2192; Code splitting with React lazy loading and Suspense</p>
    <p>&#x2192; Using the Browser router to handle dynamic routing</p>
    <p> &#x2192; Custom hooks to keep components clean and readable</p>

### Firebase

<div id="firebase" />

<GridStyles flip>

With my priority being to get up and running with a working MVP Firbase seemed
like an obvious choice given that they will handle authorisation. I used the Firstore
database to store user generated entries with content management handled on the
frontend. Images are stored using firebase storage and image compression is run
client side. Firebase Auth handles authorisation and gives users access to the
content management/ user profile section of the site.

<div
  style={{
    width: '380px',
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'column',
    justifyContent: 'space-around',
  }}
>
  <img
    src="/signup.png"

    height="240"
  />
  <img
    src="/edit-blog.png"
    alt="Visit Munich edit page screenshot"
    width="380"
  />
</div>

</GridStyles>

### Redux

The app implements Redux stores for handling state, uses Redux Thunk for the async logic which updates the backend and makes extensive use of the hooks provided by React Redux. I also use the data subscription hooks provided by React-Redux-Firebase.

### Styled-Components

<div id="styled-components" />

<GridStyles>
  Having started with inline CSS I soon found that as the project grew this was
  becoming more and more inpractical so switched to Styled Components as they
  offer a neet component based syntax which fits well with React. Nesting and
  the ability to pass in props was
</GridStyles>

export default ({ children }) => (
  <ProjectLayout meta={meta}>{children}</ProjectLayout>
);
