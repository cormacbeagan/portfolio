  For years I have been looking for a way to recommend works of street art to
  the guests of the hostel where I have been working for these past years.
  However it is not easy to give someone directions to a random motorway bridge
  over the Isar....

    So I set out to create a website which allows any user to easily add their
    favorite attraction, recommendation, piece of graffiti or bridge for others
    to see. There are a few other add ons such as a long term weather forcast
    and a map of live concerts for more opportunities to plan a great stay in
    Munich.

### React

    <p>
      The project was started with Create React App, and makes good use of
      Reacts component base architecture and the latest functional/hook based
      syntax.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has however grown significantly from the original graffiti map leading
      to the adoption of a few advanced features such as code splitting with lazy loading and browser routing.

### Firebase

With my priority being to get up and running with a working MVP Firbase seemed
like an obvious choice given that they will handle authorisation. I used the Firstore
database to store user generated entries with content management handled on the
frontend. Images are stored using firebase storage and image compression is run
client side. Firebase Auth handles authorisation and gives users access to the
content-management/user profile section of the site.

### Redux

The app implements Redux stores for handling state, uses Redux Thunk for the async logic which updates the backend and makes extensive use of the hooks provided by React Redux. I also use the data subscription hooks provided by React-Redux-Firebase.

### Styled-Components

<GridStyles single>
  <p>
    Having started with inline CSS I soon found that as the project grew this
    was becoming more and more inpractical so switched to Styled Components as
    they offer a neet component based syntax which fits well with React. Nesting
    and the ability to pass in props being tht most exciting features.

export default ({ children }) => (
  <ProjectLayout meta={meta}>{children}</ProjectLayout>
);
